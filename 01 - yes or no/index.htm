	OH HI THERE!
	============

	How are you? You are viewing the source code for this web app.
	This is a comment. It is here for you to read - it doesn't change
	anything about the app. There are lots of comments in this app to
	help you make changes to it.

	If you are in the session, we will talk through what to do. If you
	are reading this outside of the session, the comments might help
	you.

	The next comment has some information about the app. Again, it's
	just for your info.

		The next comments explain the bit of code which follows.
		When you see ***CHANGE THIS***, there is an example of
		something you can change, to make this *your* app.

		Just change the code as suggested, save the file, and reload
		it in your browser to see what happens. You are making an app!

		You can change anything you like! Some of it won't do anything.
		Some of it will break the app. That's OK.

		Remember: FAIL = First Attempt In Learning. If things go wrong,
		try again. When it works, you will have made something new.

		If the app seems broken, don't worry. Just undo your changes
		and save it again. If things get really broken, you can start
		again from the original app.

		Let's make your own copy of this app, so we can start
		editing it. Select all the code (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A) and copy it
		(Ctrl+C or Cmd+C) then open a new text file and paste it
		(Ctrl+V or Cmd+V). Then save the file somewhere you can find
		it, like your desktop. IMPORTANT: the file name needs to end
		with .html. You can call it yesno.html or anything.html
		
		When you have done that, drag the new file onto your browser 
		to try out your copy. It should be the same as the original.

		Every time you make a change, save the file, and click reload
		in your browser. You can see what effect the change had.

<!--
	You have reached the end of the code for this web app!
	If you have changed all of the CHANGE THIS parts, well done.
	If you got it working how you wanted it, great.
	Why not go through again and make it do something different.

	Can you make the app do this?

		Is it cold today?
			YES -> Wear a coat
			NO -> No need to wear a coat

	Can you make the app ask any yes/no question and give your
	choice of answers? OF COURSE YOU CAN!

	If you enjoyed this, and you want to learn more, you can:
		* Read through the comments and the code
		* Try changing more things like text, colours and numbers
		* Learn by doing more at codecademy.com (no affiliation to us)
